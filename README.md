<h2 align="left">👋 Hi there, I'm Lei Gabriel</h2>

---

I'm a graphic designer, UI designer, and frontend developer passionate about creating beautiful and functional digital experiences.

I enjoy bringing ideas to life through design and code—whether it's crafting brand identities, designing intuitive interfaces, or building responsive web applications with modern technologies.

Currently learning and growing my skills in React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while exploring the intersection of design and development.
